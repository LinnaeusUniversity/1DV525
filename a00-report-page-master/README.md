Create a Report page for the course
=====================

You should create your own website for the reports you will write during the course.



Take a copy of `example/report`
---------------------

There is a sample website in `example/report` that you can copy from to get going quickly.

Save your website in a directory `web`, in the root of the repo.

You can now use your texteditor to check out the files that now are available in `web/`. It is a set of HTML, CSS and JavaScript files with some images. It is a simple website.

You can review it by opening it up in you web browser.



Make the site "your own"
---------------------

Review all files in the website and update them to look as part of your own website. Remove the template text and write your own personlized text.

You shall do the following.

1. Update `me.html` so that it contains a short presentation about your self and attach a image that represents yourself. You may anonymize yourself if you are concerned with privacy.

1. In the page `report.html` you will write reports on the course assignments. There will be one report from each assignment and some final words.

1. In the page `about.html`:
    1. Add an image of your liking, as you find representing this course.
    1. Get the link to the source course repo on GitHub and link to it.
    1. Get the link to your forked course repo on GitHub and link to it.

1. You can update the stylesheet and possibly JavaScript in the `css/` and `js/` directories. It is not necessary, do it if you want and feel that you have time.



Add, commit, tag and push
---------------------

1. Add all files to the repo, commit them and push to the GitLab repo. You may commit and push as many times as you wish.

1. Add a tag to the repo, just for the fun of it. Add v0.1.0, or just 0.1.0, and ensure you can push your changes to GitLab, including the tag.

1. Do not forget to push both the repo and the tags to GitLab.
